### The template:

This template uses the most recent [aastex61](http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex.html) and
[emulateapj](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~alexey/emulateapj) latex class files
to produce pdf files as close to published ApJ documents as we could get, including a couple of bug fixes and add ons (see top-apj.tex) beyond those provided by the AAS template.
The template is also compatible with the article class (for proposals).

The template.tex and template.pdf files should be self explanatory of the features provided by this template.

### Known issues (help!):

- There is an awful long space between the author list and the institution list.
- The institutions list is right aligned rather than center.
- Long URL hypertexts run out of the column boundaries.
